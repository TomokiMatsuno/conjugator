# conjugator
A Neural Conjugator for Universal Morphological Inflection Task 1.

# Model description
This model learns how to conjugate words from dictionary-conjugated form pairs and their morphosintacitic information.
The structure is almost a simple encoder-decoder model with attention except that this model employs bilinear attention with a diagonalized weight matrix.

# Performance
This exceeds the baseline model of the shared task in most of the languages.
